# helloAuth

## Requirements

  - Java 1.8.x+

## Building and running

Grails comes with it's own wrapper. Many of the grails commands can also be accomplished with gradle (a wrapper for this is also included).

**Build and start the app**

    $ ./grailsw run-app

**Useful commands**

    $ ./grailsw clean #dump build files

## Using it

Once the app is running [helloAuth](http://localhost:8080), you can navigate to the helloWorldController. At the login prompt, the username/pass is admin/password. On success, you should see the hello world page.
